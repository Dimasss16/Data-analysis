This Python project performs a statistical analysis of artwork data from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The dataset contains various details about artworks, such as artist information, artwork titles, creation dates, mediums, and more.

The project uses the `pandas` library to explore the dataset, form hypotheses, and calculate metrics for deeper insights. It includes data filtering, sorting, and descriptive statistical methods to reveal patterns in the MoMA collection. Key analyses involve measures of central tendency, frequency distributions, and the creation of new columns based on specific criteria.

Visualization tools such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are used to illustrate findings with different plots, including line graphs, bar charts, and pie charts. These visualizations clarify statistical results, providing a more detailed understanding of the MoMA artwork collection's characteristics and trends.

Additionally, a _WordCloud_ showcases the most prominent artists of the period, offering a unique viewpoint on the artistic landscape represented in the MoMA dataset.
