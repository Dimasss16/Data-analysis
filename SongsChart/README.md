This Python project utilizes the `pandas` library to analyze song chart data thoroughly. It begins with loading and preprocessing data, then calculates statistics for key columns, and applies data filtering and sorting techniques. The project also explores descriptive statistics for numerical features.

The analysis includes central tendency measures for hit songs, regular songs, and peak ranks, in addition to the hit count for each singer.

Data visualization is achieved using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, which generate box plots to help identify outliers. Seaborn is also used to create a correlation matrix, showing relationships between different variables. The interpretation of these tables and visualizations aids in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
